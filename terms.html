  <h2>1) Introduction</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (collectively, the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) are a legally binding contract between you (“<strong>you</strong>”) and <strong>SimHaDo For Business</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) governing your access to and use of the mobile software application <strong>Invoice Maker Pro</strong> and its website pages (the “<strong>App</strong>”).</p>
  <p>By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not install or use the App.</p>

  <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for individuals who are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). The App is not intended for children under 13. If you are 13–17, you may use the App only with the consent and direct supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to this Agreement.</p>

  <h2>3) The Service</h2>
  <p>The App provides tools to create invoices, manage clients and items, choose templates, add a logo, and export invoices to PDF. The App may let you store <em>payment details</em> (e.g., bank info, PayPal, crypto wallet) <strong>only to print/show them on invoices</strong>. The App does not move, remit, or process funds and does not provide payment services.</p>

  <h2>4) License Grant</h2>
  <p>Subject to this Agreement, we grant you a personal, limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the App on Apple-branded devices you own or control and as permitted by the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <li>Impersonating any person or entity, or misrepresenting your affiliation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) User Content</h2>
  <p>You are solely responsible for information you input into the App (e.g., company name, client details, line items, saved payment details). You represent that you have all rights necessary to use and display such content on invoices you generate and share. We do not claim ownership of your content.</p>

  <h2>7) Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App (including code, design, templates, and documentation) is owned by SimHaDo For Business and protected by applicable laws. Except for the license granted in Section 4, no rights are transferred to you. Feedback you provide may be used by us without restriction or compensation.</p>

    <li><strong>Trials.</strong> If offered, a trial converts to a paid subscription unless canceled at least 24 hours before the trial ends. Any unused trial portion is forfeited upon purchase.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing & Taxes.</strong> Prices may vary by region and are subject to taxes and exchange rates determined by Apple.</li>
    <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds are handled by Apple according to its policies.</li>

  <h2>11) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App relies on Apple services for subscriptions and may optionally use analytics and crash reporting. Third-party terms may apply. We are not responsible for third-party services or websites you access via links.</p>

  <h2>12) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.</p>

  <h2>13) Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>
