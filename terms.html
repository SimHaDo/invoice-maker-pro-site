    <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By downloading or using Invoice Maker Pro (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (the ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù). If you do not agree, do not download, install, or use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App; if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may only use the App under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms. The App is intended for personal or business use and not for children‚Äôs use.</p>

    <h2>3. License grant</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use one copy of the App on Apple-branded devices you own or control, strictly in accordance with these Terms and the Apple Media Services terms.</p>

    <h2>4. Prohibited conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or attempting to derive the source code, except to the extent permitted by applicable law.</li>
      <li>Modifying, redistributing, reselling, renting, leasing, lending, or sublicensing the App.</li>
      <li>Infringing intellectual property or privacy rights; using the App for unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful purposes.</li>
      <li>Uploading or generating content that is illegal, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
      <li>Using the App to provide emergency services or for safety-critical use cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Accounts & access</h2>
    <p><strong>No Accounts.</strong> The App does not use user accounts or authentication. In-app account deletion is not applicable. You are responsible for the security of your device and iCloud settings if you enable iCloud sync.</p>

    <h2>6. Content you create</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the content you enter and the PDFs you generate or share. You represent that you have all rights to include such content (e.g., logos). We do not access your on-device or iCloud content unless you choose to share it with us (e.g., via email for support).</p>

    <h2>7. Subscriptions & billing (Apple IAP)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pro is offered as an auto-renewing subscription via Apple In-App Purchase. Pricing is shown in the App and may vary by region.</li>
      <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation and on renewal unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
      <li>Manage or cancel in Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions. We do not have access to your full billing data and cannot cancel on your behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Restore Purchases</strong> is available within the App for previously purchased subscriptions on the same Apple ID.</li>
      <li>Terms of subscription and the Privacy Policy are displayed in-app near the purchase button and available via links: <a href="terms.html">Terms</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="privacy.html">Privacy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. No third-party advertising; no tracking</h2>
    <p>The App contains no third-party advertising SDKs and does not track users across apps or websites. We do not use Apple‚Äôs App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its user interface, graphics, and code, is protected by intellectual-property laws. Except for the license granted herein, no rights are transferred to you. All trademarks, logos, and brand names are the property of their respective owners. You may not remove or alter proprietary notices.</p>

    <h2>10. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>The App relies on Apple services (StoreKit, iCloud if enabled). Your use of such services is subject to Apple‚Äôs terms and privacy policies. Links from the App or site to third-party resources are provided for convenience; we are not responsible for their content or policies.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù AND ‚ÄúAS AVAILABLE‚Äù WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SIMHADO FOR BUSINESS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE APP OR SUBSCRIPTION IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>13. Export & sanctions compliance</h2>
    <p>You represent that you are not located in an embargoed country and are not on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You agree to comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws.</p>

    <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SimHaDo For Business and its affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees) arising out of your misuse of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>15. Apple-specific terms (third-party beneficiary)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and SimHaDo For Business, not Apple. Apple is not responsible for the App or its content.</li>
      <li>Apple has no obligation to furnish maintenance or support services for the App.</li>
      <li>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple may refund the purchase price (if any). To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no other warranty obligations with respect to the App.</li>
      <li>Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>16. Changes to the App and Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update the App and these Terms from time to time (e.g., to improve features or comply with law). We will update the ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date and, where required, notify you in-app. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>17. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your license if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use and delete the App. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitation of liability, governing law) shall survive termination.</p>

    <h2>18. Governing law; venue; dispute resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue lie in the state and federal courts located in Kentucky. The parties waive any objection to personal jurisdiction and venue.</p>
    <p class="small">Optional: If you prefer arbitration, replace the paragraph above with an FAA-governed arbitration clause and class-action waiver consistent with your counsel‚Äôs advice for your target markets.</p>

    <h2>19. Severability; assignment; entire agreement</h2>
    <p>If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. These Terms constitute the entire agreement regarding the App.</p>
