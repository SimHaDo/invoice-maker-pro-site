    <h1>Terms of Use & End-User License Agreement</h1>
    <p class="notice">Last updated: <strong>2025-09-30</strong> ‚Ä¢ Legal Entity: SimHaDo For Business (Kentucky 40214, USA) ‚Ä¢ Contact: <a href="mailto:dd925648@gmail.com">dd925648@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use and End-User License Agreement (collectively, the ‚Äú<strong>Agreement</strong>‚Äù) are a legally binding agreement between you (‚Äú<strong>you</strong>‚Äù or ‚Äú<strong>user</strong>‚Äù) and <strong>SimHaDo For Business</strong> (‚Äú<strong>we</strong>‚Äù, ‚Äú<strong>us</strong>‚Äù, or ‚Äú<strong>our</strong>‚Äù) governing your use of the mobile software application <strong>Invoice Maker Pro</strong> and any related websites, content, templates, documentation or services provided within or in connection with the App (collectively, the ‚Äú<strong>App</strong>‚Äù).</p>
    <p>By downloading, installing, accessing or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not download, install or use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility & Children</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use the App. If you are 13‚Äì17 years old, you may use the App only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who accepts this Agreement on your behalf.</li>
      <li>The App is not directed to children under 13 and must not be used by them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Nature of the App ‚Äî Not a Payment Processor</h2>
    <p>The App is a utility that helps you create and export invoices and save your <em>own</em> payment details (e.g., bank, PayPal, crypto address) for display on invoices. The App does <strong>not</strong> process payments, transmit funds, provide escrow, verify beneficiaries, or act as a money services business. Any payments you receive occur outside the App, via channels you and your counterparties independently use. You are solely responsible for verifying payment instructions, addresses (including crypto addresses and memos/tags), and for compliance with all applicable laws (including tax and invoicing regulations).</p>

    <h2>4. License Grant & Restrictions</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download and use one copy of the App on Apple-branded devices you own or control and as permitted by the App Store Terms.</p>
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App (except where such restrictions are prohibited by applicable law).</li>
      <li>Do not rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the App or any rights to it.</li>
      <li>Do not use the App for unlawful purposes or to infringe any third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy or publicity rights.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to bypass technical protections, limits or security features.</li>
      <li>Do not use the App to publish illegal content, spam, malware, or content that is defamatory, obscene, hateful, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Account, Device & Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for the security of your device and the confidentiality of any data you store in the App (including client lists, invoices and payment details).</li>
      <li>Some App data is stored locally on your device and may synchronize to iCloud if you enable Apple iCloud features. You are responsible for your Apple settings, backups and device security.</li>
      <li>Logos and other materials you import remain your content (see Section 9).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Subscriptions, Billing & Auto-Renewal (Apple IAP)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pro Subscription.</strong> Certain features (e.g., premium templates, unlimited invoices, saved payment presets, logo branding) may require an auto-renewing subscription (‚Äú<strong>Pro</strong>‚Äù) purchased via Apple In-App Purchase (<strong>IAP</strong>).</li>
      <li><strong>Billing & Renewal.</strong> Payment is charged to your Apple ID at purchase confirmation and will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your Apple ID will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the price shown in the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage Subscription.</strong> You can manage and cancel in your device‚Äôs App Store account settings. We do not have access to your full billing details and cannot cancel on your behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Trials.</strong> If offered, any free trial converts to a paid subscription unless canceled at least 24 hours before the trial ends. Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited when you purchase.</li>
      <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds are handled solely by Apple according to App Store policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Price/Features Changes.</strong> We may change subscription pricing and features prospectively to the extent permitted by Apple policies; Apple will notify you where required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Availability, Updates & Support</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App may change or be discontinued at any time without liability. We may release updates (including security updates) that you may need to install to continue using the App.</li>
      <li>Performance depends on your device, iOS version, storage, connectivity, and iCloud settings. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</li>
      <li>Support is provided via email: <a href="mailto:dd925648@gmail.com">dd925648@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>
